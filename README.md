#Deployment
1. Dependencies of TheHackademic involve a web server (Apache, nginx) with PHP and Mysql Database connected with it. Make sure      you have installed these before you start deploying TheHackademic. Recommendation would be to use Apache with MySQL.  
   Clone this project : git clone https://github.com/messi96/TheHackademic
   Copy the folder TheHackademic to your apache or nginxdefault web directory i.e. /var/www/html or your default one.
   Change the permissions : sudo chmod -R 765 Thehackademic.
   Ensure that your Apache service is running along with mysql service.
   Be sure to configure mysql according to your settings.
   Type localhost in your Browser and TheHackademic HomePage will be served.
